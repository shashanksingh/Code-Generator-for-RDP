look at demo.def on how to create defination files which will generate the code inside generated directory 
the demo.def has defination for different related documents of ms-rdpbcgr aka MS Remote dekstop 
but the first class is from [ms-fscc] http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff359535(v=prot.10).aspx

The code has a Lexer written usign Reg EX
it has syntax checker written using if else contructs in qt/c++
and code generator/I.L. also written in QT/c++
